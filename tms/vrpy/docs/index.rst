VRPy Documentation
====================

VRPy is a python framework for solving instances of different types of Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) including:

-   the Capacitated VRP (CVRP),
-   the CVRP with resource constraints,
-   the CVRP with time windows (CVRPTW),
-   the CVRP with simultaneous distribution and collection (CVRPSDC),
-   the CVRP with heterogeneous fleet (HFCVRP).

Check out section :ref:`vrp` to find more variants and options.

VRPy relies on the well known NetworkX_ package (graph manipulation), as well as on cspy_, a library for solving the resource constrained shortest path problem.

There is no guarantee that VRPy returns the optimal solution. See section :ref:`colgen` for more details, and section :ref:`benchmarks`
for performance comparisons with OR-Tools_.
